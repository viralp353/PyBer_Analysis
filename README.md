# PyBer_Analysis


## Object:

*  Create a bubble chart that showcases the average fare versus the total number of rides with bubble size based on the total number of drivers for each city type, including urban, suburban, and rural.




* Create box-and-whisker plots that visualize each of the following to determine if there are any outliers:

     (1)The number of rides for each city type.


     (2)The fares for each city type.


     (3)The number of drivers for each city type.



* Create a pie chart that visualizes each of the following data for each city type:


     (1)The percent of total fares.


     (2)The percent of total rides.


     (3)The percent of total drivers.

 (3)Delivering Results:
 
 
*  I got chllenge for this module.I wiil require to use everything I learned in this module.creating a summary DataFrame of the key metrics for the ride-sharing data by city type; creating a multiple-line graph that shows the total fares for each week by each city type; and submitting a written report on the results of the new analysis, challenges you encountered and overcame.This data analysis DataFrame shows a perfect overview of a summary of DataFrame of ride_sharing data by city and also included "Total Ride","Total Driver","Total Fare"."Averange fare per ride" and "Averange fare per Driver".for  DataFrame analyze I need a find total driver,total fare & total ride per each city type by using groupby()function.After find all things.create a DataFrame.Next,we look at  A multiple-line chart, with one line for each city type, that shows the sum of the fares for each week.For Chart,I need a find a Weekly based fare in each type of city then weekly based covert in month in chart.I did use all of function find all things like,groupby(),su m(),loc[start:End],datatime converter,resample(), FiveThirtyEight chart style.See on DataFrame,it can provide some infromation like Urban Has a good report about Total ride and Total Driver  as compare  Rural&Suburban.Next,see on chart Urban had good fare based on monthly.




* For this Challenge,I didn't face any difficulties.As per my Opinion,We need look at data. Sometimes chnage in structure,Naming coflicts,Misspellings,  Redundancy/duplicates, Empty Records makes errors.That's why we need a handle a carefully when working code.For this challenge ,We need a handel carefully function like-groupby(),sum(),loc[start:End],datatime converter,resample(), FiveThirtyEight chart style,Month locator,Pivot table DatFrame etc..




* Data Analysis  on DataFrame shows perfect overview for CEO,As Per my Analysis I would like recommend to CEO.They need a add some more drivers in Rural and Suburban.More Drivers  get more ride and get more fare.As per DataFrame ,Urban has  more  drivers then around 5%   Suburban & 30% Rural.That'Why Total Fare were high then other city type.As per DataFame,Suburban was  also good as comapare drivers & ride with Urban.For other part of analysis on Chart,We can see  that feb to march good for Urban and Suburaban and Apr to may  good for Rural.Averange fare per driver were good in rural and suburban city type.Other part of analysis on chart clearly say that add more drivers in rural and  suburban.CEO also need good marketing in rural and suburban by  providing some coupon code,some discount on ride.On other side for Urban, CEO need  focus on customers satisfaction  on ride.because provide good service  wiil be turn into more ride.Based on analysis on month,It played also important role for ride so i would recommend to CEO to see also month factor.Finally, CEO need a look on Marketing monitoring,Customer growth,Demand ride,safety provide to customer and also use entertainment industy for marketing of Pyber application.

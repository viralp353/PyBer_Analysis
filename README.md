# PyBer_Analysis


## Object:

*  Create a bubble chart that showcases the average fare versus the total number of rides with bubble size based on the total number of drivers for each city type, including urban, suburban, and rural.




* Create box-and-whisker plots that visualize each of the following to determine if there are any outliers:

     (1)The number of rides for each city type.


     (2)The fares for each city type.


     (3)The number of drivers for each city type.



* Create a pie chart that visualizes each of the following data for each city type:


     (1)The percent of total fares.


     (2)The percent of total rides.


     (3)The percent of total drivers.

 (3)Delivering Results:
 
 
*  I got chllenge for this module.I wiil require to use everything I learned in this module.creating a summary DataFrame of the key metrics for the ride-sharing data by city type; creating a multiple-line graph that shows the total fares for each week by each city type; and submitting a written report on the results of the new analysis, challenges you encountered and overcame.This data analysis DataFrame shows a perfect overview of a summary of DataFrame of ride_sharing data by city and also included "Total Ride","Total Driver","Total Fare"."Averange fare per ride" and "Averange fare per Driver".for  DataFrame analyze I need a find total driver,total fare & total ride per each city type by using groupby()function.After find all things.create a DataFrame.Next,we look at  A multiple-line chart, with one line for each city type, that shows the sum of the fares for each week.For Chart,I need a find a Weekly based fare in each type of city then weekly based covert in month in chart.I did use all of function find all things like,groupby(),su m(),loc[start:End],datatime converter,resample(), FiveThirtyEight chart style.See on DataFrame,it can provide some infromation like Urban Has a good report about Total ride and Total Driver  as compare  Rural&Suburban.Next,see on chart Urban had good fare based on monthly.
